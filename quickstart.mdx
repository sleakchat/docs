## Get Started with Untyped

Welcome to Untyped! This guide will help you connect your email and start using your AI email assistant right away.

<Step title="Sign up and connect your email">
  Visit [beta.getuntyped.ai](https://beta.getuntyped.ai) and sign in with either your Gmail or Outlook account.

<Step title="Complete the onboarding">
  After connecting your email, Untyped will guide you through a quick onboarding process where your AI agent learns from your email history.
  
  This typically takes a few minutes depending on your inbox size. You can see the progress in your agent dashboard.

<Step title="Review your first draft">
  Once onboarding is complete, Untyped will start analyzing your incoming emails and generating draft responses.
  
  Navigate to your email inbox (Gmail or Outlook) to see draft suggestions for emails that need replies.
  
  <Tip>
  Your AI agent gets better over time as it learns more about how you communicate!

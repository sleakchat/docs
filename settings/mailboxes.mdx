## Mailbox Status

Each connected mailbox shows its current status:

### Active

Everything is working correctly:
- ‚úÖ Connection is healthy
- ‚úÖ Syncing regularly
- ‚úÖ Drafts are being generated

### Syncing

Currently updating with new emails:
- üîÑ Processing new messages
- üîÑ Updating knowledge base
- üîÑ Generating drafts

### Error

There's a problem that needs attention:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Connection failed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Permission revoked
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication expired

<Warning>
If you see an error status, click on the mailbox to see details and fix the issue.
</Warning>

### Paused

Temporarily stopped by you:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Not syncing new emails
- ‚è∏Ô∏è No new drafts being generated
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Can be resumed anytime

## Mailbox Settings

Click on any connected mailbox to configure:

### Sync Options

**Sync Frequency:**
- Real-time (recommended)
- Every hour
- Every 4 hours
- Manual only

**Folders/Labels:**
- All folders
- Inbox only
- Custom selection

**Date Range:**
- All history
- Last 30 days
- Last 6 months
- Last year
- Custom date range

<Tip>
Syncing less history makes setup faster but gives your agent less context to learn from.
</Tip>

### Draft Settings

Control draft generation for this mailbox:

- **Enable/disable drafts** for this mailbox
- **Default prompt** or use mailbox-specific prompt
- **Draft priority** (useful if you have multiple mailboxes)

### Label Management

For Gmail mailboxes:
- Choose which labels to sync
- Map labels to Untyped categories
- Exclude promotional/spam folders

For Outlook mailboxes:
- Select folders to sync
- Map categories
- Exclude clutter

## Managing Multiple Mailboxes

If you connect multiple email accounts:

### Primary Mailbox

Designate one mailbox as primary:
- Shows first in your dashboard
- Default for new rules
- Primary analytics source

### Mailbox Rules

Create rules specific to each mailbox:

**Example:**
```
Work Mailbox (work@company.com):
- Professional tone
- Formal greetings
- Include signature with title

Personal Mailbox (personal@gmail.com):
- Casual tone
- Brief responses
- Simple sign-off
```

### Cross-Mailbox Features

- **Unified Dashboard**: See analytics across all mailboxes
- **Shared Knowledge**: Agent learns from all connected accounts
- **Separate Drafts**: Drafts appear in the correct mailbox

<Note>
Your agent combines learnings from all mailboxes to improve draft quality, but keeps drafts and responses separate per account.
</Note>

## Reconnecting a Mailbox

If your mailbox shows an error:

<Steps>

<Step title="Click 'Reconnect'">
  Find the mailbox with an error and click the reconnect button
</Step>

<Step title="Reauthorize access">
  Sign in again and grant permissions
  
  <Note>
  Common reasons for disconnection: password change, revoked permissions, expired tokens
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify connection">
  Once reconnected, sync will resume automatically
</Step>

</Steps>

## Pausing a Mailbox

Temporarily stop syncing without disconnecting:

**When to pause:**
- Going on vacation
- Testing Untyped with one account first
- Mailbox is receiving high volume temporarily
- Troubleshooting issues

**While paused:**
- No new emails are synced
- No drafts are generated
- Existing data and rules remain
- Can resume anytime with one click

<Tip>
Pausing is great for vacation mode - your agent won't generate drafts while you're away.
</Tip>

## Disconnecting a Mailbox

Permanently remove a mailbox from Untyped:

<Warning>
Disconnecting deletes all data related to this mailbox, including knowledge base entries, drafts, and learnings. This cannot be undone.
</Warning>

<Steps>

<Step title="Select the mailbox">
  Find the mailbox you want to disconnect
</Step>

<Step title="Click 'Disconnect'">
  You'll see a confirmation warning
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm deletion">
  Type the mailbox email address to confirm
  
  <Note>
  This doesn't affect your actual email account - only removes it from Untyped
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Revoke permissions (optional)">
  For complete disconnection, revoke Untyped's access in your email provider's security settings
</Step>

</Steps>

## Storage Management

Each mailbox uses storage for:

- Email metadata
- Knowledge base entries  
- Draft history
- Analytics data

**Storage limits by plan:**
- **Free Trial**: 1 GB per mailbox
- **Pro**: 10 GB per mailbox
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Mailbox stuck in 'Syncing' status">
  This is normal for large inboxes during initial setup. If it persists for over an hour:
  - Pause and resume the sync
  - Check your internet connection
  - Reduce the date range being synced
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission errors">
  Common causes:
  - Changed your email password
  - Revoked access in email security settings
  - Two-factor authentication issue
  
  Solution: Click "Reconnect" and reauthorize
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Not all emails are syncing">
  Check:
  - Folder/label selection (are all desired folders selected?)
  - Date range settings
  - Storage limits (free tier has limits)
  - Email provider restrictions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't remove mailbox">
  Make sure:
  - You have at least one other mailbox connected (can't remove your only mailbox)
  - You have proper permissions
  - Try pausing first, then disconnecting
</Accordion>

## Your Mailboxes

View your connected email accounts in the Mailboxes section of your [Untyped dashboard](https://beta.getuntyped.ai).

<Note>
Adding additional mailboxes will be available shortly. Currently, you can manage the mailbox you connected during onboarding.
</Note>

## Understanding Mailbox Status

Your mailbox can have different statuses depending on its current state:

### Active

Your mailbox is connected and working normally.

**What this means:**
- ✅ Connection to your email provider is healthy
- ✅ Emails are syncing regularly in the background
- ✅ Drafts are being generated for new emails based on your rules
- ✅ Your AI agent is learning from your email patterns

Everything is functioning as expected. No action needed.

### Syncing

Your mailbox is currently processing emails.

**What this means:**
- 🔄 New emails are being analyzed and imported
- 🔄 The knowledge base is being updated with new contacts and patterns
- 🔄 Drafts are being generated for emails that need replies
- 🔄 Labels are being applied based on your auto-categorization settings

**When you'll see this:**
- During initial setup (can take 10-30 minutes for large inboxes)
- After reconnecting a mailbox
- When processing a backlog of emails
- Periodically during normal operation (usually very brief)

<Tip>
First-time sync can take a while for large inboxes. This is normal - your agent is learning from your entire email history.
</Tip>

### Error

There's a connection problem that needs your attention.

**What this means:**
- ⚠️ Untyped cannot access your mailbox
- ⚠️ No new emails are being synced
- ⚠️ Draft generation has stopped
- ⚠️ Immediate action required to restore service

**Common causes:**
- **Password changed**: You updated your email password but didn't reconnect
- **Permissions revoked**: You removed Untyped's access in your Google/Microsoft account settings
- **Token expired**: Your authentication needs to be refreshed (happens automatically every few months)
- **Account suspended**: Your email provider has temporarily blocked access

**How to fix:**
1. Go to your Mailbox settings in the dashboard
2. Click "Reconnect" on the mailbox showing an error
3. Sign in and reauthorize Untyped's access
4. Syncing will resume automatically

<Warning>
If you see an error status, fix it as soon as possible. Your AI agent can't generate drafts or learn from new emails until the connection is restored.
</Warning>

### Paused

You've temporarily stopped syncing for this mailbox.

**What this means:**
- ⏸️ Not syncing new emails
- ⏸️ No new drafts being generated
- ⏸️ Existing data and settings are preserved
- ⏸️ Can be resumed anytime with one click

**When to pause:**
- Going on vacation and don't want draft suggestions piling up
- Testing settings with a different mailbox
- Temporarily reducing email processing load
- Troubleshooting connection issues

**While paused:**
- Your emails still arrive normally in Gmail/Outlook
- Untyped just isn't processing them
- All your data, rules, and settings remain intact
- Resume anytime to catch up on missed emails

<Accordion title="Untyped not working? Check permissions">
  If Untyped isn't syncing or drafting emails, the most common issue is missing Google Account permissions.
  
  **How to fix:**
  
  1. Go to your [Google Account permissions page](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
  2. Find "Untyped" in your connected apps
  3. Make sure the checkbox for **"Read, compose and send emails from your Gmail account"** is checked

  </Frame>
  
  If the permission is unchecked, check it and click Continue. Untyped should start working within a few minutes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Permission denied error'>
  If you see a permission error during sign-in, make sure your Google account allows third-party apps. Go to your Google Account settings and verify that security settings permit app access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't see certain emails">
  Untyped respects Gmail's native filtering. If you have filters that archive or delete emails automatically, Untyped won't process those emails.

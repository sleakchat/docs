## Troubleshooting Outlook Connection

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I see a notice that says 'Need admin approval'">
  Some organizations require IT approval before you can connect new apps.
  
  **If you are a user:** Ask your IT department to approve Untyped.
  
  **If you are an IT Admin:** Follow our [Microsoft 365 Admin Setup Guide](/troubleshooting/microsoft-365-admin-setup) to whitelist Untyped.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Untyped isn't organizing my emails">
  If you are connected but your emails aren't being labeled or moved, you likely skipped the configuration step. **Solution:** You must go to your dashboard settings and choose whether Untyped should
  use **Folders** or **Categories**. Without this, the AI cannot touch your emails. [View the Setup Guide](/troubleshooting/outlook-settings)

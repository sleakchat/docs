## Connect Your Email Account

Untyped works with both Gmail and Outlook accounts.

- [Gmail](/connecting-email/gmail)
- [Outlook](/connecting-email/outlook)

## Permissions

Untyped requires read and send permissions to function effectively:

- **Read access**: To learn from your email history and understand your communication patterns
- **Send access**: To create draft responses in your inbox (you always have final approval before sending)
- **Label/folder access**: To categorize and organize emails automatically

<Warning>Untyped never sends emails without your explicit approval. All drafts are suggestions that you can edit, approve, or discard.</Warning>

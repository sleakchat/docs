description: 'Solution: Grant organization-wide access to Untyped for Microsoft 365 and Outlook users'

## Overview

**Untyped securely integrates with Microsoft 365** to organize inboxes, draft smart replies, and capture meeting notes automatically.

To enable Outlook connections for your team, an admin needs to grant Untyped permission in **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD). This step authorizes a secure, organization-wide connection through Microsoft's verified OAuth process.

## Granting Access to Untyped

Admins can approve Untyped using one of **two methods**:

### Method 1: Grant Consent During Untyped Login

This is the quickest way to enable access for all users.

<Steps>

<Step title='Navigate to Untyped'>Go to [beta.getuntyped.ai](https://beta.getuntyped.ai) and click **Continue with Microsoft/Outlook**</Step>

<Step title='Sign in as admin'>Sign in using your Microsoft admin account</Step>

<Step title='Grant organization consent'>
  On the Permissions requested screen: - Check: **Consent on behalf of your organization** - Click **Accept**
  <Frame>
    <img src='/images/troubleshooting/adminpermissions.png' alt='Consent on behalf of organization checkbox' />
  </Frame>
</Step>

</Steps>

This grants consent for all users in your organization immediately - including anyone who previously saw a "Need admin approval" message. After consent is granted, those users simply need to try connecting again.

<Warning>If you miss this option during setup, use Method 2 below.</Warning>

### Method 2: Grant Consent in Microsoft Entra Portal

Use this method to manage permissions centrally or approve Untyped retroactively.

<Steps>

<Step title='Open Microsoft Entra ID'>
  Go to [Microsoft Entra ID → Enterprise apps](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/~/AppAppsPreview)
  <Frame>
    <img src='/images/troubleshooting/approve_admin.png' alt='Microsoft Entra Enterprise Apps' />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title='Find Untyped'>
  Search for **Untyped** in the enterprise applications list
  <Warning>Make sure to remove any active filters while searching</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title='Navigate to Permissions'>Go to **Security → Permissions**</Step>

<Step title='Grant admin consent'>Click **Grant Admin consent for Untyped** button to accept permissions</Step>

</Steps>

Once approved, all users can connect Untyped without individual admin approval.

<Warning>If you never did this before - You should first allow users to request access if they encounter a "Need admin approval" message.</Warning>

## Optional Configuration

### Enable Admin Consent Requests

<Steps>

<Step title='Open Consent Settings'>In **Microsoft Entra ID**, go to **Enterprise Apps → Consent and permissions**</Step>

<Step title='Configure Admin Consent Settings'>Select **Admin Consent Settings**</Step>

<Step title='Enable user requests'>
  Set **Users can request admin consent to apps they are unable to consent to** to **Yes** - Under Reviewer Type, select the Users/Groups/Roles that should be able to review such requests
  <Frame>
    <img src='/images/troubleshooting/entra_adminaccess.png' alt='Microsoft Entra Enterprise Apps' />
  </Frame>
  Make sure to **check the top checkbox to 'Yes'**, and then to add groups or users that should be able to request app permissions. Don't forget to save the new configuration after making the changes.
</Step>

</Steps>

Once enabled, users can request approval directly from the Microsoft sign-in prompt.

#### How to review user requests

1. Go to [**Microsoft Entra ID → Enterprise Applications → Admin Consent Requests**](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/~/AccessRequests)
2. You'll see a list of all access requests submitted by your users
3. Review and approve/deny requests as needed

### Adjust Assignment Settings

<Note>This step is **optional**, but recommended for most organizations.</Note>

Turning off "Assignment required?" ensures users can connect to Untyped without you having to manually assign them to the app in Entra. If your organization uses strict app assignment policies, you may prefer to leave this enabled.

**To allow all users to connect without individual assignment:**

<Steps>

<Step title='Select Untyped in Enterprise Applications'>In **Enterprise Applications**, select Untyped</Step>

<Step title='Open Properties'>Go to **Manage → Properties**</Step>

<Step title='Disable assignment requirement'>Set **Assignment required?** to **No**</Step>

</Steps>

This allows all users in your tenant to connect automatically.

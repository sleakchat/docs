## Using Your Exported Data

### Import to Spreadsheets

CSV exports work directly with:

- **Excel**: Open CSV files
- **Google Sheets**: Import CSV
- **LibreOffice**: Open in Calc
- **Numbers**: Import data

### Analyze with Code

JSON exports can be processed with:

**Python:**
```python

with open('knowledge/contacts.json') as f:
    contacts = json.load(f)
    
for contact in contacts:
    print(f"{contact['name']}: {contact['email_count']} emails")
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const contacts = JSON.parse(
  fs.readFileSync('knowledge/contacts.json')
);

contacts.forEach(contact => {
  console.log(`${contact.name}: ${contact.email_count} emails`);
});
```

### Transfer to Other Services

Export formats are designed to be compatible with:

- Other email AI tools
- CRM systems

<Note>
While we use standard formats, each service has different import requirements. You may need to transform the data format.

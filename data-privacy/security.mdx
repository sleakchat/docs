## Security Overview

Untyped implements industry-leading security practices to protect your email data and account.

<Note>
We treat your email data with the same security standards as financial institutions handle your money.
</Note>

## Data Encryption

### Encryption at Rest

All stored data is encrypted using:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256 encryption
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with automatic key rotation
- **Scope**: All email content, metadata, and user data

<Tip>
AES-256 is the same encryption standard used by banks and government agencies. It would take billions of years to crack with current technology.
</Tip>

### Encryption in Transit

All data transmission uses:

- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3 (latest standard)
- **Certificate**: 2048-bit RSA keys
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each session uses unique encryption keys

**What this means:**
- No one can intercept data between you and Untyped
- Even we can't read data in transit
- Past sessions can't be decrypted if keys are compromised

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Hosting

Hosted on AWS with:

- **Regions**: Multiple availability zones
- **Isolation**: Separate VPCs per environment
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 automated threat detection
- **DDoS Protection**: AWS Shield Standard

### Database Security

Our databases feature:

- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: IP whitelist + credential authentication
- **Backups**: Encrypted, geo-redundant, tested monthly
- **Isolation**: Database not accessible from public internet

### Network Security

Protected by multiple layers:

1. **Firewall**: Only essential ports open
2. **WAF**: Web Application Firewall blocks attacks
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attempts
4. **IP Filtering**: Suspicious IPs automatically blocked

## Application Security

### Authentication

Secure account access with:

**OAuth 2.0:**
- Sign in via Google/Microsoft (no password to steal)
- Tokens expire regularly
- Refresh tokens securely stored

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
- Available for all accounts
- TOTP-based (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Backup codes provided
- Strongly recommended

<Warning>
Enable 2FA for maximum account security. It prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.
</Warning>

### Session Management

Your sessions are secured with:

- **Timeout**: Auto-logout after 7 days of inactivity
- **Device Tracking**: See all active sessions
- **Remote Logout**: End sessions from any device
- **Anomaly Detection**: Suspicious logins trigger alerts

### Password Security (if using password login)

If you create a password:

- **Hashing**: bcrypt with high cost factor
- **Salting**: Unique salt per password
- **Requirements**: Minimum 12 characters, complexity enforced
- **Breach Detection**: Checked against known compromised passwords

<Tip>
We recommend using OAuth (Google/Microsoft) instead of passwords for enhanced security.
</Tip>

## API Security

For developers using our API:

### Authentication

- **API Keys**: Randomly generated, high entropy
- **Key Rotation**: Rotate keys anytime
- **Scope Limits**: Keys limited to specific permissions
- **Expiration**: Set key expiry dates

### Rate Limiting

Prevents abuse with:

- Per-key rate limits
- Endpoint-specific limits
- Automatic temporary bans for violations
- Graceful degradation under attack

### Input Validation

All API inputs are:

- Sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Type-checked and validated
- Size-limited to prevent overflow
- Logged for security monitoring

## Email Security

### Email Provider Connection

When connecting to Gmail/Outlook:

**OAuth Tokens:**
- Stored encrypted in our database
- Refresh tokens rotated regularly
- Revocable at any time
- Never logged or exposed

**Permissions:**
- Minimum necessary access only
- Scoped to specific functions
- Auditable by you in your email provider's security settings

**Transmission:**
- All email API calls use TLS 1.3
- No email content stored in logs
- Rate-limited to prevent scraping

### Draft Security

Email drafts are:

- Encrypted in storage
- Never sent automatically (you always review)
- Deleted after 90 days
- Not accessible via our API

## Access Control

### Internal Access

Strict policies for Untyped employees:

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Access limited to job requirements only
- Regular access reviews
- Automatic deprovisioning on role change

**No Access to User Data:**
- Engineers can't view your emails
- Support needs your explicit permission
- All access is logged and audited
- Multi-person approval required for any manual data access

**Background Checks:**
- All employees undergo background checks
- NDA and security training required
- Regular security awareness training

### Audit Logging

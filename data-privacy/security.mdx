## Encryption

All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+ and at rest with AES-256. OAuth tokens are stored encrypted and rotated regularly to minimize exposure.

## Infrastructure

**Cloud Security**

We host on Microsoft Azure within the EEA, using isolated production environments with network access controls and DDoS protection.

**Database Protection**

Databases are encrypted, accessible only via role-based access with MFA, and completely isolated from the public internet. Automated backups run regularly.

## Authentication

**OAuth 2.0**

Sign in securely via Google or Microsoft. No passwords to manage or steal.

**Two-Factor Authentication**

Add an extra security layer with authenticator apps. Strongly recommended for all accounts.

<Tip>Enable 2FA in your email account for enhanced security.</Tip>

## Access Control

We enforce least-privilege access policies with mandatory MFA for all staff who can access production systems. Every access is logged and auditable, and support can only view your data with your explicit permission.

## Security Practices

We conduct code reviews and vulnerability scanning, manage dependencies with timely patching, and maintain 24/7 monitoring for suspicious activity. Documented incident response procedures ensure rapid handling of any issues.

**Report Issues**

Found a vulnerability? We appreciate responsible disclosure: [hi@getuntyped.ai](mailto:hi@getuntyped.ai)

## Data Deletion

When you close your account or disconnect your email:

- Email data deleted within 30 days

<Warning>If you notice suspicious activity, revoke all sessions and contact us immediately.</Warning>

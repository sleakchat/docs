## What Are Diagnostics?

Diagnostics are anonymous activity logs that help us understand how Untyped performs in real-world usage. This data allows us to identify bugs, optimize performance, and improve your experience.

<Note>Sharing diagnostics is completely optional. Untyped works fully whether this feature is enabled or disabled.</Note>

## What We Collect

When you enable diagnostic sharing, we collect:

**Performance Metrics**

Response times, loading speeds, and feature usage patterns help us identify bottlenecks and optimize the app.

**Error Logs**

Anonymous error reports and stack traces enable us to fix bugs faster and prevent crashes.

**Feature Usage**

Understanding which features are used most helps us prioritize development and improvements.

**Agent Performance**

Draft quality metrics, categorization accuracy, and interaction patterns help improve AI suggestions.

## What We Don't Collect

- Email content or message bodies
- Personal information or identifiable data
- Contact names or email addresses
- Anything that could identify you individually

All diagnostic data is anonymized before collection. We cannot trace it back to your account or identity.

## Data Retention

Diagnostic data is automatically deleted after **30 days**. We don't build long-term profiles or keep historical records of your usage patterns.

## How to Enable

1. Go to your account settings
2. Navigate to "Privacy & Security"
3. Toggle "Share diagnostics with Untyped"

You can disable this feature at any time, and any previously collected data will be deleted within 30 days.

## How It Helps

Your diagnostic data helps us:

**Fix Bugs Faster**

Error reports show us exactly where things break and how to fix them.

**Optimize Performance**

Performance metrics reveal slow operations we can speed up.

**Improve AI Accuracy**

Anonymous quality metrics help us refine draft generation and categorization.

**Prioritize Features**

Usage patterns show which features matter most to our users.

## Privacy Commitment

Even with diagnostics enabled:

- No email content is ever collected
- Data is anonymized immediately
- Nothing is shared with third parties
- Everything is deleted after 30 days
- You can opt out anytime

<Tip>Enabling diagnostics helps us make Untyped better for everyone while keeping your data private.</Tip>

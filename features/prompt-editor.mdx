## What is the Prompt Editor?

The Prompt Editor lets you customize your AI agent's behavior by providing specific instructions on how it should write emails, what tone to use, and what information to include or avoid.

<Note>
Think of your prompt as a set of guidelines you'd give to a personal assistant who handles your email.
</Note>

## Accessing the Prompt Editor

1. Log in to [beta.getuntyped.ai](https://beta.getuntyped.ai)
2. Navigate to the Prompt Editor from the main menu
3. View and edit your current prompt

## Prompt Components

Your prompt consists of several key elements:

### Writing Style

Define how your agent should write:
- **Tone**: Professional, casual, friendly, formal
- **Length**: Concise, moderate, detailed
- **Structure**: Direct, conversational, structured

**Example:**
```
Write in a friendly but professional tone. Keep responses
concise (2-3 paragraphs max). Use casual greetings like
"Hi" or "Hey" with colleagues, "Dear" with external contacts.
```

### Content Guidelines

Specify what to include:
- Key information that should always appear
- Standard phrases or sign-offs
- Required disclaimers or notices

**Example:**
```
Always check my calendar before confirming meetings.
Include my phone number in emails to external clients.
Sign off with "Best regards" for formal emails, "Cheers" for
casual ones.
```

### Restrictions

Tell your agent what to avoid:
- Words or phrases not to use
- Topics to skip
- Information to never include

**Example:**
```
Never share internal project codenames with external contacts.
Avoid using "Sorry for the delay" - instead say "Thanks for
your patience."
Don't make commitments about deadlines without checking with me.
```

### Special Instructions

Add context-specific guidance:
- How to handle specific senders
- Industry-specific terminology
- Company-specific policies

**Example:**
```
When responding to sales inquiries, always mention our 14-day
trial. For customer support emails, start by acknowledging
their issue specifically.
```

## Prompt Templates

### Professional Business

```
Tone: Professional and courteous
Length: 2-3 paragraphs
Structure: Clear and direct

Begin with a brief greeting. Get to the point quickly.
End with a clear call to action or next step.
Always proofread for grammar and clarity.
```

### Casual Startup

```
Tone: Friendly and approachable
Length: Keep it brief
Structure: Conversational

Write like we're chatting. Use contractions (we're, don't).
Be enthusiastic but authentic. Emojis are fine for internal
team communication.
```

### Customer Support

```
Tone: Empathetic and helpful
Length: Thorough but scannable
Structure: Problem-solution-next steps

Start by acknowledging their specific issue. Provide
clear solutions with step-by-step instructions. End with
an offer to help further. Always be patient and understanding.
```

<Tip>
Start with a template and customize it based on how you actually write. Your agent will refine its style based on your edits over time.
</Tip>

## Editing Your Prompt

<Steps>

<Step title="Review current prompt">
  Read through your existing prompt to understand what your agent is currently following.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify improvements">
  Think about recent drafts:
  - What did you frequently edit?
  - What was missing?
  - What tone adjustments did you make?
</Step>

<Step title="Update instructions">
  Make specific, clear changes to your prompt. Be explicit about what you want.
</Step>

<Step title="Test the changes">
  Review the next few drafts your agent creates. The changes should take effect immediately.
</Step>

<Step title="Refine as needed">
  Keep adjusting your prompt based on results. It's an iterative process.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Be Specific

**Instead of:**
```
Be professional
```

**Write:**
```
Use formal language with external clients. Address them by
last name until they suggest otherwise. Keep responses
under 3 paragraphs.
```

### Use Examples

**Instead of:**
```
Write concisely
```

**Write:**
```
Write concisely - aim for 50-100 words per email unless
detailed explanation is needed. Example: "Thanks for reaching
out! I can meet Thursday at 2pm. Let me know if that works."
```

### Prioritize Instructions

Put the most important guidelines first:

1. Critical rules (what never to do)
2. Tone and style preferences
3. Standard inclusions (signature, disclaimers)
4. Nice-to-haves (optional flourishes)

### Update Regularly

Review and update your prompt:
- Monthly for active changes
- After role changes
- When feedback patterns emerge

<Warning>
Dramatic prompt changes can temporarily affect draft quality while your agent adapts. Make incremental changes for best results.
</Warning>

## Advanced Techniques

### Conditional Instructions

Set rules for different scenarios:

```
For meeting requests:
- Check availability before confirming
- Propose 2-3 alternative times if unavailable
- Always include video call link for virtual meetings

For project updates:
- Start with progress summary
- Highlight any blockers
- End with next milestone and deadline
```

### Persona-Based Prompts

Create different styles for different audiences:

```
Internal team: Casual, brief, emoji-friendly
Clients: Professional, thorough, no emoji
Executives: Concise, data-driven, action-oriented
```

### Learning Directives

Tell your agent how to learn:

```
Pay special attention to how I edit:
- Sign-off phrases
- Opening lines
- Paragraph length

When I delete entire sections, don't include
similar content in future drafts.
```

## Testing Your Prompt

After updating your prompt:

1. Wait for 2-3 new draft emails
2. Review if they match your instructions
3. Note any discrepancies
4. Refine the prompt for clarity

<Tip>
Your agent combines your prompt with learned patterns from your actual email edits. Both work together to improve draft quality.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Prompt changes not taking effect">
  Make sure you saved your prompt. Changes are applied to new drafts immediately, but won't retroactively change existing drafts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent ignoring some instructions">
  Check if your instructions conflict with each other. Also, your agent balances prompt instructions with learned behavior - if you consistently edit away from the prompt, it will adapt to your actual style.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too many instructions causing confusion">
  Simplify your prompt. Focus on the top 5-10 most important guidelines. Over-complicating can reduce draft quality.

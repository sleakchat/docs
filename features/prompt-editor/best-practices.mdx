## Best Practices

### Be Specific

**Instead of:**
```
Be professional
```

**Write:**
```
Use formal language with external clients. Address them by
last name until they suggest otherwise. Keep responses
under 3 paragraphs.
```

### Use Examples

**Instead of:**
```
Write concisely
```

**Write:**
```
Write concisely - aim for 50-100 words per email unless
detailed explanation is needed. Example: "Thanks for reaching
out! I can meet Thursday at 2pm. Let me know if that works."
```

### Prioritize Instructions

Put the most important guidelines first:

1. Critical rules (what never to do)
2. Tone and style preferences
3. Standard inclusions (signature, disclaimers)
4. Nice-to-haves (optional flourishes)

### Update Regularly

Review and update your prompt:
- Monthly for active changes
- After role changes
- When feedback patterns emerge

<Warning>
Dramatic prompt changes can temporarily affect draft quality while your agent adapts. Make incremental changes for best results.
</Warning>

## Advanced Techniques

### Conditional Instructions

Set rules for different scenarios:

```
For meeting requests:
- Check availability before confirming
- Propose 2-3 alternative times if unavailable
- Always include video call link for virtual meetings

For project updates:
- Start with progress summary
- Highlight any blockers
- End with next milestone and deadline
```

### Persona-Based Prompts

Create different styles for different audiences:

```
Internal team: Casual, brief, emoji-friendly
Clients: Professional, thorough, no emoji
Executives: Concise, data-driven, action-oriented
```

### Learning Directives

Tell your agent how to learn:

```
Pay special attention to how I edit:
- Sign-off phrases
- Opening lines
- Paragraph length

When I delete entire sections, don't include
similar content in future drafts.
```

## Testing Your Prompt

After updating your prompt:

1. Wait for 2-3 new draft emails
2. Review if they match your instructions
3. Note any discrepancies
4. Refine the prompt for clarity

<Tip>
Your agent combines your prompt with learned patterns from your actual email edits. Both work together to improve draft quality.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Prompt changes not taking effect">
  Make sure you saved your prompt. Changes are applied to new drafts immediately, but won't retroactively change existing drafts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent ignoring some instructions">
  Check if your instructions conflict with each other. Also, your agent balances prompt instructions with learned behavior - if you consistently edit away from the prompt, it will adapt to your actual style.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too many instructions causing confusion">
  Simplify your prompt. Focus on the top 5-10 most important guidelines. Over-complicating can reduce draft quality.

## Prompt Templates

### Professional Business

```
Tone: Professional and courteous
Length: 2-3 paragraphs
Structure: Clear and direct

Begin with a brief greeting. Get to the point quickly.
End with a clear call to action or next step.
Always proofread for grammar and clarity.
```

### Casual Startup

```
Tone: Friendly and approachable
Length: Keep it brief
Structure: Conversational

Write like we're chatting. Use contractions (we're, don't).
Be enthusiastic but authentic. Emojis are fine for internal
team communication.
```

### Customer Support

```
Tone: Empathetic and helpful
Length: Thorough but scannable
Structure: Problem-solution-next steps

Start by acknowledging their specific issue. Provide
clear solutions with step-by-step instructions. End with
an offer to help further. Always be patient and understanding.
```

<Tip>
Start with a template and customize it based on how you actually write. Your agent will refine its style based on your edits over time.

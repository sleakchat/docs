### Writing Style

Define how your agent should write:
- **Tone**: Professional, casual, friendly, formal
- **Length**: Concise, moderate, detailed
- **Structure**: Direct, conversational, structured

**Example:**
```
Write in a friendly but professional tone. Keep responses
concise (2-3 paragraphs max). Use casual greetings like
"Hi" or "Hey" with colleagues, "Dear" with external contacts.
```

### Content Guidelines

Specify what to include:
- Key information that should always appear
- Standard phrases or sign-offs
- Required disclaimers or notices

**Example:**
```
Always check my calendar before confirming meetings.
Include my phone number in emails to external clients.
Sign off with "Best regards" for formal emails, "Cheers" for
casual ones.
```

### Restrictions

Tell your agent what to avoid:
- Words or phrases not to use
- Topics to skip
- Information to never include

**Example:**
```
Never share internal project codenames with external contacts.
Avoid using "Sorry for the delay" - instead say "Thanks for
your patience."
Don't make commitments about deadlines without checking with me.
```

### Special Instructions

Add context-specific guidance:
- How to handle specific senders
- Industry-specific terminology
- Company-specific policies

**Example:**
```
When responding to sales inquiries, always mention our 14-day
trial. For customer support emails, start by acknowledging
their issue specifically.
```

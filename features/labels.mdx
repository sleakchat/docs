## Auto-Categorization

Untyped automatically categorizes your emails using smart labels, helping you stay organized without manual effort.

## How Labels Work

Your AI agent analyzes each email and assigns appropriate labels based on:

- Content and subject matter
- Sender and recipient
- Email thread history

<Note>Labels are applied automatically in your email client (Gmail or Outlook) so you can filter and search more easily.</Note>

Automatically categorize emails into mailbox labels based on their content. When enabled, Untyped analyzes incoming emails and assigns appropriate labels.

The label is always re-generated based on the last email received in a thread and can override existing labels.

### Default Label Categories

Each label can be individually enabled or disabled (except "Needs reply" which is always on):

- **Needs reply** (always enabled): Email requires a direct response from you
- **FYI**: Informational email for awareness, no action required
- **To do**: Email contains tasks or action items to complete
- **Notification**: System or service notification, automated message
- **Update**: Status update or progress report on existing matters
- **Awaiting reply**: Email is waiting for a response from someone else
- **Promotion**: Marketing or promotional content

<Note>"Needs reply" is always enabled and cannot be turned off - these emails will always get a draft suggestion.</Note>

<Tip>You can customize which labels to use in Settings. Custom label categories coming in Q1 2026.</Tip>

## Finding Labeled Emails

### In Gmail

Labels appear in your Gmail sidebar:

1. Click on any label to see all emails in that category
2. Use Gmail's search with `label:category-name`
3. Create filters based on Untyped's labels

### In Outlook

Categories appear as color-coded markers:

1. Filter by category in your inbox view
2. Use search with `category:name`
3. Group emails by category for easy organization

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title='Emails are being mislabeled'>
  This is normal in the first few days. Manually correct the labels, and your agent will learn. You can also create specific rules for consistently mislabeled patterns.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Too many labels cluttering my inbox'>Reduce the number of active labels in Settings. Focus on the categories that matter most to you.</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Labels not syncing to my email client'>Check your sync settings and ensure Untyped has permission to modify labels/categories in your email account.</Accordion>

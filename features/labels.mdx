## Auto-Categorization

Untyped automatically categorizes your emails using smart labels, helping you stay organized without manual effort.

## How Labels Work

Your AI agent analyzes each email and assigns appropriate labels based on:
- Content and subject matter
- Sender and recipient
- Email thread history
- Patterns from your inbox

<Note>
Labels are applied automatically in your email client (Gmail or Outlook) so you can filter and search more easily.
</Note>

## Default Label Categories

Untyped uses these standard categories:

### Work & Business

- **Projects**: Emails related to specific projects
- **Meetings**: Meeting requests and calendar invites
- **Tasks**: Action items and to-dos
- **Urgent**: Time-sensitive emails requiring immediate attention

### Personal

- **Family**: Communication with family members
- **Friends**: Personal correspondence
- **Finance**: Bills, invoices, and financial matters
- **Travel**: Bookings, confirmations, and itineraries

### Automated

- **Newsletters**: Subscriptions and marketing emails
- **Notifications**: System alerts and automated messages
- **Receipts**: Purchase confirmations and invoices
- **Social**: Updates from social media platforms

<Tip>
You can customize which labels to use and create your own categories in [Rules](/features/rules).
</Tip>

## Finding Labeled Emails

### In Gmail

Labels appear in your Gmail sidebar:
1. Click on any label to see all emails in that category
2. Use Gmail's search with `label:category-name`
3. Create filters based on Untyped's labels

### In Outlook

Categories appear as color-coded markers:
1. Filter by category in your inbox view
2. Use search with `category:name`
3. Group emails by category for easy organization

## Custom Labels

You can create custom labels for specific needs:

<Steps>

<Step title="Define your label">
  Decide what type of emails should get this label (e.g., "Client Communication", "Invoices", "Team Updates")
</Step>

<Step title="Create a rule">
  Go to [Rules](/features/rules) and set up conditions for when to apply your custom label
</Step>

<Step title="Review and refine">
  Check how your new label is being applied and adjust the rule if needed
</Step>

</Steps>

## Label Accuracy

Your agent gets better at labeling over time:

- **Initial setup**: ~80% accuracy as it learns your patterns
- **After 1 week**: ~90% accuracy with basic corrections
- **After 1 month**: ~95%+ accuracy with fine-tuned rules

### Improving Accuracy

Help your agent label better by:
- Moving mislabeled emails to the correct label
- Creating rules for specific sender patterns
- Providing clear folder structure in your inbox

<Tip>
When you manually correct a label, your agent remembers and applies that pattern to similar emails in the future.
</Tip>

## Label Management

### Archive Old Labels

Keep your inbox clean by archiving labels you no longer use:
1. Go to Settings
2. Select Label Management
3. Archive or delete unused labels

### Merge Similar Labels

If you have duplicate or overlapping labels:
1. Choose which label to keep
2. Merge the others into it
3. All historical emails will be relabeled

### Export Label Data

You can export your label configuration to:
- Back up your setup
- Transfer to another account
- Share with team members

## Search and Filters

Use labels to create powerful searches:

**Find all urgent work emails:**
```
label:work label:urgent
```

**Exclude newsletters:**
```
-label:newsletters
```

**Recent family emails:**
```
label:family after:7d
```

## Integration with Other Features

- Which emails need draft responses
- What tone to use in the draft
- Priority order for drafting

### Rules

Labels trigger specific rules:

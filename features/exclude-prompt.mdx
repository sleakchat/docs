<Note>Use exclude prompt when the [base sensitivity sliders](/features/rules) aren't enough. This gives you fine-grained control to describe specific email types that don't need replies.</Note>

## What is Exclude Prompt?

Exclude prompt lets you describe in plain language which emails don't need replies. Instead of manually skipping drafts, teach the AI your preferences once.

## How It Works

Write rules in natural language describing emails that don't need responses. The AI applies these rules automatically to skip draft creation.

**Example rules:**

- Automated notifications and system alerts
- Newsletters and marketing emails
- Calendar invites I've already responded to
- "Thank you" or confirmation messages
- FYIs with no questions

<Tip>Be specific. Instead of "newsletters," try "weekly digest emails and automated reports."</Tip>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title='Navigate to Rules'>Go to Rules → Exclude more tab at [app.getuntyped.ai](https://app.getuntyped.ai/rules)</Step>
  <Step title='Describe exclusions'>Write which emails don't need replies in the text box</Step>
  <Step title='Save'>Click Save to apply your rules</Step>
</Steps>

## Combine with Base Sensitivity

Exclude prompt works alongside [base sensitivity](/features/rules):

- **Base sensitivity**: Sets overall draft frequency
- **Exclude prompt**: Defines specific categories to skip

Use both for precise control—set sensitivity to "Often" and exclude routine emails you never need to reply to.

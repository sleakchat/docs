## What is the Knowledge Base?

Your Knowledge Base is where Untyped stores insights your AI agent has learned from analyzing your email history. It helps your agent create more personalized and contextually relevant draft responses.

<Note>
All insights are private to you and derived solely from your email data. Untyped never shares your knowledge base with third parties.
</Note>

## What Your Agent Learns

### Contact Information

For each person you communicate with, your agent tracks:

**Communication Patterns:**
- How frequently you email
- Typical response time
- Common topics discussed
- Preferred communication style

**Relationship Context:**

- Company or organization
- How you met or connected
- Nature of relationship (colleague, client, friend)

**Preferences:**
- Their preferred greeting
- Time zone and working hours
- Communication preferences
- Topics of interest

<Tip>
Your agent uses this context to craft more personalized draft responses that reference shared history and inside knowledge.
</Tip>

**Writing Style:**
- Your typical greeting and sign-off

## Using Knowledge Base Insights

### Drafts Reference Knowledge

**Add Personal Context:**
```
"Hope your team's product launch went well last week!"
```

**Reference Past Conversations:**
```
"Following up on the proposal we discussed in March..."
```

**Respect Preferences:**
```
Uses "Dr. Smith" instead of "Jane" based on formality pattern
```

**Suggest Relevant Information:**
```
"I've attached the Q3 report you mentioned needing"
```

### Improve Draft Quality

Knowledge base insights make drafts:
- More personal and relevant
- Contextually aware
- Appropriately toned
- Proactive about information needs

### Add Manual Notes

Include information your agent couldn't learn from emails:

of confidentiality. She prefers calls over emails for
sensitive topics. Based in London (8hr ahead).
```

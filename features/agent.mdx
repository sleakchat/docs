## Your AI Agent

Your Untyped AI agent is your personal email assistant that learns from your communication style and helps you manage your inbox more efficiently.

## Agent Dashboard

The agent dashboard gives you visibility into what your AI is learning and how it's performing.

### Onboarding Progress

When you first connect your email, your agent goes through an onboarding process:

<Steps>

<Step title="Email History Analysis">
  Your agent reads through your past emails to understand your communication patterns, writing style, and common contacts.
</Step>

<Step title="Pattern Recognition">
  The AI identifies how you typically respond to different types of emails, your tone preferences, and any recurring themes.
</Step>

<Step title="Training Complete">
  Once enough data is processed, your agent is ready to start generating personalized draft responses.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Note>
Onboarding typically takes 5-15 minutes depending on your inbox size. You can continue using your email normally during this process.
</Note>

## Agent Analytics

### Email Processing Stats

See how many emails your agent has:
- Analyzed from your history
- Generated drafts for
- Successfully helped you respond to

### Response Accuracy

Track how often you:
- Use drafts as-is
- Edit drafts before sending
- Discard drafts

<Tip>
Higher edit rates early on are normal! Your agent improves as it learns your preferences.
</Tip>

### Time Saved

Untyped estimates how much time your agent has saved you based on:
- Number of draft responses used
- Average email composition time
- Reduced back-and-forth in conversations

## What Your Agent Learns

### Communication Patterns

Your agent understands:
- How you greet different types of contacts (formal vs casual)
- Your preferred email structure
- Common phrases and expressions you use
- How you sign off emails

### Contact Insights

The agent tracks:
- Who you communicate with most frequently
- Response patterns with specific people
- Relationship context (colleague, client, friend)

### Email Categories

Your agent recognizes different types of emails:
- Questions requiring answers
- Meeting scheduling
- Project updates
- Customer support
- Personal correspondence

## Agent Settings

### Sync Schedule

Control how often your agent syncs with your email:
- Real-time (processes emails as they arrive)
- Every hour
- Every 4 hours
- Manual sync only

### Learning Preferences

Choose what your agent should focus on:
- Recent emails only (last 3 months)
- All email history
- Specific folders or labels

<Warning>
Processing all email history may take longer but provides better context for your agent's responses.
</Warning>

## Agent Status

Your dashboard shows your agent's current status:

- **Active**: Processing emails and generating drafts
- **Syncing**: Updating with new emails
- **Learning**: Analyzing patterns from recent activity
- **Paused**: Temporarily stopped (you can resume anytime)

## Improving Agent Performance

### Provide Clear Feedback

Your agent learns best when you:
- Edit drafts to show your preferred style
- Use rules to guide behavior
- Update your prompt with specific instructions

### Regular Prompt Updates

As your communication needs change, update your [Prompt](/features/prompt-editor) to reflect:
- New role or responsibilities
- Different tone preferences
- Special handling for new contacts

### Review Knowledge Base

Periodically check your [Knowledge Base](/features/knowledge) to ensure your agent has accurate information about your contacts and preferences.

## Privacy Controls

You control what your agent can access:

- Choose which mailboxes to analyze
- Exclude specific folders or labels
- Pause learning at any time
- Export or delete agent data

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Agent status shows 'Error'">
  This usually means there's an issue connecting to your email account. Try:
  1. Reconnecting your mailbox in [Settings](/settings/mailboxes)
  2. Checking that Untyped still has the required permissions
  3. Contacting support if the issue persists
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Onboarding taking too long">
  If onboarding has been running for more than 30 minutes, try:
  - Refreshing your dashboard
  - Manually triggering a sync
  - Reducing the email history range in agent settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent not improving over time">
  Make sure you're actively editing drafts to provide feedback. The agent learns from your corrections and adjustments.
</Accordion>

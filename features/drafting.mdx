## What is AI Email Drafting?

Untyped's AI email drafting is your personal writing assistant that generates email responses based on your unique communication style. By learning from your past emails, Untyped creates draft replies that sound like you.

<Note>
Email drafts are suggestions only. You always have the final say before any email is sent.
</Note>

## How It Works

<Steps>

<Step title="Untyped analyzes incoming emails">
  When you receive a new email, Untyped automatically reads and understands the context, tone, and what kind of response is needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Your agent generates a draft">
  Based on your email history and communication patterns, your AI agent creates a personalized draft response that matches your writing style.
</Step>

<Step title="You review and customize">
  The draft appears in your email inbox. You can use it as-is, edit it, or discard it completely. You're always in control.
</Step>

<Step title="Send when ready">
  Once you're happy with the email, hit send. Your agent learns from your edits and gets better over time.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Key Features

### Personalized Writing Style

Untyped learns how you write by analyzing:
- Your typical greeting and closing phrases
- Tone and formality level
- Sentence structure and vocabulary
- How you handle different types of requests

<Tip>
The more emails Untyped processes, the better it gets at matching your unique voice.
</Tip>

### Context-Aware Responses

Your AI agent considers:
- The full email thread history
- Your previous interactions with the sender
- Important details and action items in the email
- Urgency and priority signals

### Smart Draft Suggestions

Untyped knows when to draft responses:
- Questions that need answers
- Meeting requests
- Follow-ups and check-ins
- Customer inquiries

<Note>
You can control which types of emails get drafts using [Rules](/features/rules).
</Note>

## Viewing and Using Drafts

Drafts appear directly in your email client (Gmail or Outlook):

1. **In Gmail**: Drafts appear in your drafts folder with a clear indicator
2. **In Outlook**: Drafts are saved in your drafts folder automatically

You can:
- Edit the draft directly
- Copy parts you like
- Delete it if it's not helpful
- Send it as-is if it's perfect

## Improving Draft Quality

### Use the Prompt Editor

Customize how your agent writes by adjusting your prompt in the [Prompt Editor](/features/prompt-editor). You can specify:
- Tone preferences (formal, casual, friendly)
- Length preferences (concise vs detailed)
- Special instructions (always include specific phrases, avoid certain words)

### Set Up Rules

Create [Rules](/features/rules) to control:
- Which emails should get drafts
- Which senders to prioritize
- Categories that need special handling

### Provide Feedback

Your agent learns from your edits:
- If you always remove a phrase, it will stop using it
- If you add specific details, it will include similar context next time
- If you adjust the tone, it will match that style going forward

## Privacy and Security

Drafts are stored securely and encrypted. Only you can see your draft suggestions. Untyped never shares your emails or drafts with third parties.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Not seeing drafts for some emails">
  Check your [Rules](/features/rules) to make sure you haven't excluded certain senders or categories. Also, your agent may determine that some emails don't need responses (like newsletters or automated messages).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Drafts don't sound like me">
  This can happen early on when your agent is still learning. Try:
  1. Updating your [Prompt](/features/prompt-editor) with more specific instructions
  2. Editing a few drafts to show the agent your preferred style
  3. Giving it more time to learn from your email history
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Getting too many drafts">
  Use [Rules](/features/rules) to limit which emails trigger draft generation. You can exclude specific senders, keywords, or email categories.
</Accordion>

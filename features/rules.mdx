## What are Rules?

Rules let you control your AI agent's behavior using two main settings: **AI Sensitivity** (when to draft replies) and **Marketing Filter** (what emails to filter out). These settings work alongside auto-categorization to give you full control over your inbox.

## AI Sensitivity

Control when Untyped should draft a reply to incoming emails. This slider has 4 levels:

**Scale:**

- **Very often** (0): Draft replies for almost every email
- **Often** (1): Draft replies for most emails that seem to need a response
- **Sometimes** (2): Only draft for emails that clearly need a reply
- **Rarely** (3): Only draft for urgent or high-priority emails

<Tip>Start with "Often" and adjust based on how many drafts you're getting. If you're overwhelmed with drafts, move it to "Sometimes" or "Rarely".</Tip>

## Marketing Filter

Control what emails get filtered out so you don't see them. This slider has 4 levels:

**Scale:**

- **Just obvious sales outreach** (0): Only filter clear promotional emails
- **Cold emails, unknown senders** (1): Filter promotional content and cold outreach
- **Cold emails, unknown sender, newsletters** (2): Filter promotions, cold emails, and newsletters
- **Anything not directly useful for my work** (3): Aggressive filtering of any non-essential emails

<Warning>Be careful with level 3 - it might filter emails you actually want to see. Start with level 1 or 2 and increase gradually.</Warning>

## How to Adjust Settings

<Steps>

<Step title='Navigate to Rules'>Go to the Rules section in your Untyped dashboard at [app.getuntyped.ai](https://app.getuntyped.ai).</Step>

<Step title='Adjust AI Sensitivity'>Use the slider to control how often drafts are created. Move left for more drafts, right for fewer.</Step>

<Step title='Set Marketing Filter'>Use the slider to control what gets filtered. Move left for light filtering, right for aggressive filtering.</Step>

<Step title='Configure Auto-Categorization'>Toggle auto-categorization on/off and enable/disable specific labels as needed.</Step>

</Steps>

Your changes are saved automatically.

- **AI Sensitivity**: Sometimes or Rarely
- **Marketing Filter**: Level 2 or 3
- **Auto-categorization**: Enabled

### For Moderate Email Volume

If you get 20-50 emails per day:

- **AI Sensitivity**: Often
- **Marketing Filter**: Level 1 or 2

If you get fewer than 20 emails per day:

- **AI Sensitivity**: Very often or Often

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title='Too many drafts being created'>Adjust the AI Sensitivity slider to the right (toward "Rarely"). Start with "Sometimes" and adjust from there.</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Missing important emails'>Your Marketing Filter might be set too high. Lower it to level 1 or 0, especially if you're missing newsletters or updates you want to see.</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Wrong labels being applied'>
  The AI learns from your email patterns. If labels are consistently wrong, try disabling auto-categorization temporarily and manually labeling emails for a few days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Not enough drafts'>Move the AI Sensitivity slider to the left (toward "Very often"). This will create more draft suggestions.</Accordion>

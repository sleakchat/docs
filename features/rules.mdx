## What are Rules?

Rules let you control your AI agent's behavior using two main settings: **AI Sensitivity** (when to draft replies) and **Marketing Filter** (what emails to filter out). These settings work alongside auto-categorization to give you full control over your inbox.

## AI Sensitivity

Control when Untyped should draft a reply to incoming emails. This slider has 4 levels:

**Scale:**
- **Very often** (0): Draft replies for almost every email
- **Often** (1): Draft replies for most emails that seem to need a response
- **Sometimes** (2): Only draft for emails that clearly need a reply
- **Rarely** (3): Only draft for urgent or high-priority emails

<Tip>
Start with "Often" and adjust based on how many drafts you're getting. If you're overwhelmed with drafts, move it to "Sometimes" or "Rarely".
</Tip>

## Marketing Filter

Control what emails get filtered out so you don't see them. This slider has 4 levels:

**Scale:**
- **Just obvious sales outreach** (0): Only filter clear promotional emails
- **Cold emails, unknown senders** (1): Filter promotional content and cold outreach
- **Cold emails, unknown sender, newsletters** (2): Filter promotions, cold emails, and newsletters
- **Anything not directly useful for my work** (3): Aggressive filtering of any non-essential emails

<Warning>
Be careful with level 3 - it might filter emails you actually want to see. Start with level 1 or 2 and increase gradually.
</Warning>

## Auto-Categorize Mailbox Labels

Automatically categorize emails into mailbox labels based on their content. When enabled, Untyped analyzes incoming emails and assigns appropriate labels.

### Available Labels

Each label can be individually enabled or disabled (except "Needs reply" which is always on):

- **Needs reply** (always enabled): Email requires a direct response from you
- **FYI**: Informational email for awareness, no action required
- **To do**: Email contains tasks or action items to complete
- **Notification**: System or service notification, automated message
- **Update**: Status update or progress report on existing matters
- **Awaiting reply**: Email is waiting for a response from someone else
- **Promotion**: Marketing or promotional content

<Note>
"Needs reply" is always enabled and cannot be turned off - these emails will always get a draft suggestion.
</Note>

If you get 20-50 emails per day:
- **AI Sensitivity**: Often
- **Marketing Filter**: Level 1 or 2

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Too many drafts being created">
  Adjust the AI Sensitivity slider to the right (toward "Rarely"). Start with "Sometimes" and adjust from there.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing important emails">
  Your Marketing Filter might be set too high. Lower it to level 1 or 0, especially if you're missing newsletters or updates you want to see.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wrong labels being applied">
  The AI learns from your email patterns. If labels are consistently wrong, try disabling auto-categorization temporarily and manually labeling emails for a few days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Not enough drafts">
  Move the AI Sensitivity slider to the left (toward "Very often"). This will create more draft suggestions.
</Accordion>

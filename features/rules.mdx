## What are Rules?

Rules let you define specific behaviors for how your AI agent should handle different emails. Think of them as "if-then" statements that automate actions based on email characteristics.

<Note>
Rules work alongside your [Prompt](/features/prompt-editor) to give you fine-grained control over your agent's behavior.
</Note>

## Common Rule Types

### Auto-Draft Rules

Control which emails get automatic draft responses:

**Example:**
```
IF sender is from @company.com
AND subject contains "urgent"
THEN create draft response within 5 minutes
```

### Categorization Rules

Automatically assign labels to specific emails:

**Example:**
```
IF sender is sales@anycompany.com
THEN apply label: "Sales Inquiries"
AND apply label: "Follow-up needed"
```

### Priority Rules

Flag important emails that need your attention:

**Example:**
```
IF sender is in "VIP Contacts"
OR subject contains "URGENT"
THEN mark as high priority
AND notify me immediately
```

### Skip Rules

Prevent drafts for certain types of emails:

**Example:**
```
IF sender is automated@notifications.com
OR subject contains "newsletter"
THEN skip draft generation
```

## Creating a Rule

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Rules">
  Navigate to the Rules section in your Untyped dashboard at [beta.getuntyped.ai](https://beta.getuntyped.ai).
</Step>

<Step title="Create new rule">
  Click "Create Rule" and choose a rule type (Draft, Label, Priority, or Skip).
</Step>

<Step title="Set conditions">
  Define when the rule should trigger:
  - Sender email or domain
  - Subject keywords
  - Email content
  - Existing labels
  - Time of day
</Step>

<Step title="Define actions">
  Specify what should happen when conditions are met:
  - Generate/skip draft
  - Apply labels
  - Set priority
  - Send notification
</Step>

<Step title="Test and activate">
  Review your rule configuration and activate it. Rules apply to new emails immediately.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Rule Conditions

You can create rules based on:

### Sender Criteria

- Specific email address
- Email domain (@company.com)
- Contact group (VIP, Team, Clients)
- Sender name

### Content Criteria

- Subject line keywords
- Email body text
- Attachment presence
- Links or URLs

### Metadata Criteria

- Time received
- Day of week
- Existing labels
- Thread length

### Relationship Criteria

- First-time sender
- Frequent contact
- Past conversation history
- Response patterns

<Tip>
Combine multiple conditions using AND/OR logic for more precise rules.
</Tip>

## Rule Actions

### Draft Generation

- Create draft immediately
- Create draft with specific tone
- Skip draft generation
- Delay draft by X hours

### Labeling

- Apply one or more labels
- Remove labels
- Replace existing label

### Notifications

- Send push notification
- Email digest
- Slack/Teams alert
- SMS (premium)

### Email Management

- Move to folder
- Archive automatically
- Mark as read/unread
- Star/flag email

## Rule Examples

### Example 1: Client Communication

**Goal:** Always draft professional responses to client emails

```
Conditions:
- Sender domain matches client domains list
- OR sender has label "Client"

Actions:
- Create draft using "Professional" tone
- Apply label "Client Communication"
- Set priority to High
```

### Example 2: Newsletter Management

**Goal:** Auto-archive newsletters without drafts

```
Conditions:
- Subject contains "newsletter" OR "unsubscribe"
- OR sender is in newsletter list

Actions:
- Skip draft generation
- Apply label "Newsletter"
- Archive email
- Mark as read
```

### Example 3: Team Coordination

**Goal:** Quick, casual responses to team emails

```
Conditions:
- Sender domain is @mycompany.com
- AND sender is in "Team" contact group

Actions:
- Create draft using "Casual" tone
- Apply label "Team"
- Aim for brief responses (under 50 words)
```

### Example 4: Meeting Requests

**Goal:** Handle calendar invites consistently

```
Conditions:
- Subject contains "meeting" OR "call" OR "sync"
- OR email contains calendar invite

Actions:
- Create draft checking calendar availability
- Propose alternative times if unavailable
- Apply label "Meetings"
```

## Rule Priority

When multiple rules could apply to the same email:

1. Rules are evaluated in order of priority (you set this)
2. First matching rule wins (unless set to continue)
3. You can allow multiple rules to apply with "Continue to next rule" option

**Example Priority:**
```
1. VIP Client rules (highest)
2. Team communication rules
3. General draft rules
4. Auto-archive rules (lowest)
```

## Managing Rules

### Enable/Disable

Temporarily turn off rules without deleting them:
- Useful for vacation mode
- Testing new workflows
- Seasonal variations

### Edit Rules

Update existing rules:
- Refine conditions
- Adjust actions
- Change priority

### Duplicate Rules

Copy existing rules to:
- Create variations
- Test modifications
- Set up similar rules faster

### Delete Rules

Remove rules you no longer need:
- Clean up your rule list
- Simplify your setup
- Remove conflicting rules

<Warning>
Deleting a rule doesn't affect emails that were already processed. It only prevents future emails from triggering that rule.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

Create 2-3 essential rules first:
1. Auto-archive newsletters
2. Priority flag for VIP contacts
3. Skip drafts for automated emails

Add more rules as you identify patterns.

### Be Specific

Vague rules can cause unexpected behavior:

**Bad:**
```
IF subject contains "hi"
THEN skip draft
```

**Good:**
```
IF sender is newsletter@company.com
AND subject contains unsubscribe link
THEN skip draft AND archive
```

### Test Thoroughly

After creating a rule:
- Monitor it for a few days
- Check for false positives
- Adjust conditions as needed

### Use Labels Strategically

Rules work great with labels:
- Create rules based on labels
- Use rules to apply labels
- Label-based workflows

### Review Regularly

Check your rules monthly:
- Remove unused rules
- Update outdated conditions
- Optimize rule order

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Rule not triggering">
  Common issues:
  - Check if rule is enabled
  - Verify conditions are written correctly
  - Ensure rule priority isn't blocked by another rule
  - Look for typos in keywords or email addresses
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too many emails matching a rule">
  Your conditions might be too broad. Add more specific criteria using AND logic to narrow down matches.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule conflicts">
  If two rules contradict each other, the higher priority rule wins. Review your rule order and adjust priorities or conditions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Drafts using wrong tone">
  Check if a rule is overriding your default prompt settings. You can specify tone in individual rules or remove tone specifications to use your default prompt.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Rule Techniques

### Time-Based Rules

Create rules that only apply at certain times:

```
IF time is 9am-5pm weekdays
AND sender is client
THEN create draft immediately

IF time is after 6pm or weekend
THEN delay draft until next business day
```

### Thread-Aware Rules

Rules that consider email thread context:

```
IF this is 3rd+ email in thread
AND I haven't responded
THEN flag as "needs response"
AND create more detailed draft
```

### Learning Rules

Rules that adapt based on your behavior:

```
IF sender matches pattern X
AND I typically edit drafts heavily for this sender
THEN create briefer draft for easier customization
```

## Integration with Other Features

Rules work seamlessly with:

- **[Labels](/features/labels)**: Apply or trigger based on labels
- **[Prompt Editor](/features/prompt-editor)**: Override default prompt behavior
- **[Agent Dashboard](/features/agent)**: Monitor rule effectiveness
- **[Draft Quality](/features/drafting)**: Control which drafts are generated

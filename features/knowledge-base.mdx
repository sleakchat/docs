Untyped allows you to upload custom **Knowledge Documents** to give your agent granular context about your business, products, specific workflows or anything else that might be important. This ensures drafts are more accurate and always aligned with your internal knowledge.

## How It Works

When an incoming email is labeled as **Needs reply** (triggering a draft generation), Untyped automatically searches your Knowledge Base.

1.  **Semantic Search:** The system analyzes the incoming email and semantically searches your uploaded documents.
2.  **Context Retrieval:** The top **20 most relevant articles** are retrieved.
3.  **Draft Generation:** These articles are provided as context to the AI agent, allowing it to write a response informed by your specific data.

<Info>
  <b>Knowledge Base context is additive.</b> The agent combines the knowledge base with the context it already learns on auto-pilot from your email history, to generate the best possible draft.

## Specs

- **Markdown Support:** Documents support Markdown formatting, allowing for structured and easy-to-read content.
- **Unlimited Uploads:** There is currently no limit to the number of knowledge documents you can add.
- **Granular Control:** Perfect for FAQs, pricing sheets, technical documentation, or other important guides.

<Note>**Coming Soon:** We are working on the ability to share Knowledge Bases across multiple mailboxes within your organization.</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Focused:** Break down large documents into smaller, topic-specific articles for better retrieval accuracy.
- **Use Clear Headings:** Markdown headings (#, ##) help the AI understand the structure and hierarchy of information.
- **Update Regularly:** Ensure your knowledge base reflects your most current policies and information.

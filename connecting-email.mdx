<Accordion title="Untyped not working? Check permissions">
  If Untyped isn't syncing or drafting emails, the most common issue is missing Google Account permissions.
  
  **How to fix:**
  
  1. Go to your [Google Account permissions page](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
  2. Find "Untyped" in your connected apps
  3. Make sure the checkbox for **"Read, compose and send emails from your Gmail account"** is checked

  If the permission is unchecked, check it and click Continue. Untyped should start working within a few minutes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied error">
  If you see a permission error during sign-in, make sure your Google account allows third-party apps. Go to your Google Account settings and verify that security settings permit app access.

<Accordion title="Can't see certain emails">
  Untyped respects Gmail's native filtering. If you have filters that archive or delete emails automatically, Untyped won't process those emails.

## What Permissions Does Untyped Need?

Untyped requires read and send permissions to function effectively:

- **Read access**: To learn from your email history and understand your communication patterns
- **Send access**: To create draft responses in your inbox (you always have final approval before sending)
- **Label/folder access**: To categorize and organize emails automatically

<Warning>
Untyped never sends emails without your explicit approval. All drafts are suggestions that you can edit, approve, or discard.
</Warning>
